# Coding Standards:

## Comments in Code Standards:

* Organization: You may use comments as a form of minimal organization within the coding file.

* Cleanliness: No "meta-comments" (e.g., // Fixed error). No commented-out code.

* Docstrings: Use docstrings for complex logic. Avoid rudimentary comments (e.g., i+=1 # increment).

* Production Comments: No overly verbose or explanatory comments. This is a production environment, and it needs to be refined and contain minimalist comments while staying organized.

* Thinking with comments: Don't write your thoughts down inside the code as comments.
